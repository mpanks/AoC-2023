# AoC-2023
Repository to hold the Advent of Code challenges this year :christmas_tree:

## Challenge 1 - Calibration
### Part 1
Given a file of strings (1-Calibration_Strings.txt) where each line contains both letters and digits, find the first and last digits and concatenate these together. Each two digit concatinated number should be added to a total for a final output.
### Part 2
With the same input file, each line contains some random characters but also written numbers (i.e. "one", "two", "three", etc). These written words should now be treated as digits, i.e. the line "one945sdfg6" should be converted to 16.

## Challenge 2 - Cube Game
### Part 1
Given another file of strings (2-Cube_Game_Strings.txt) where each line is a hypothetical game outcome, with a game ID, the colour of each cube and the number of each cube of the given colour for each hand in that game. I.e. Game 5: 7 blue, 4 red, 6 green; 2 red, 3 green, 6 blue; 11 blue, 1 red, 5 green. This game consisted of three hands where the first hand saw 7 blue cubes, 4 red and 6 green. The next hand then saw 2 red, 3 green and 6 blue, etc.
This challenge informed us that there are only 12 red, 13 green and 14 blue cubes. With this information, we were to find the sum of the IDs for all possible games (as a game which showed any more than 12 red, 13 green or 14 blue cubes in any one hand cannot occur).
### Part 2
Using the same file of strings, we were to find the minimum number of each coloured cube for each game and then multiply the minimum number of red, blue and green cubes together to find the "minimum power". The sum of each games "minimum power" was submitted for this challenge.

## Challenge 3 -
